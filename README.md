Tree Traversal Practice
Objective: The objective of this assignment is to practice implementing and understanding different tree traversal algorithms.

Problem Statement: You are provided with a binary tree data structure. Your task is to implement various traversal algorithms recursively and analyze their traversal order and output.

Task 1

Implement the in-order traversal algorithm for the given binary tree.
Task 2

Implement the pre-order traversal algorithm for the given binary tree.
Task 3

Implement the post-order traversal algorithm for the given binary tree.
task 4

Test the implemented traversal algorithms on a binary tree and observe the traversal order and output.
Expected Outcomes:

Successful implementation of in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal algorithms.
Understanding of the traversal order and output for each algorithm.
Practice in analyzing and comparing different traversal techniques.
NOTE: Ensure that all code in your file is ready to run. This means that if someone opens your file and clicks the run button at the top, all code executes as intended. For example, if there are if statements, print statements, or for loops, they should function correctly and display output in the console as expected. If you have a function, make sure the function is called and runs. If there are classes/objects, make sure they are instantiated and the methods are called.

The goal of this note is to ensure that all code in your
